# Library Book Management System - Academic Exercise

## Act 1 - The Library's Challenge

In a quaint town, the local library is facing challenges managing its extensive collection of books. The librarian, Ms. Anderson, seeks a solution to optimize the book management process.

### 1. Introduction to the Library's Book Collection

Ms. Anderson introduces the library's vast collection of books, which includes thousands of titles spanning various genres and authors.

### 2. The Outdated Book Management System

The current book management system at the library is outdated and inefficient. It makes it challenging for the library staff to keep track of borrowed books, returns, and restocking. The system lacks organization, leading to confusion and delays.

### 3. Access to the Library's Database

To find a solution, Ms. Anderson shares access to the library's database, which contains an array of book objects. Each book object has properties like "title," "author," "ISBN," "genre," and "status."

## Act 2 - Enhancing the Book Management System

With a clear understanding of the library's book collection and the existing challenges, Ms. Anderson decides to explore JavaScript and NodeJS as tools to optimize the library's book management system.

Ms. Anderson collaborates with a skilled developer to devise a plan to optimize the library's book management system. They identify specific tasks they need to tackle, such as finding available books, sorting books by genre, counting borrowed books, and tracking due dates.
